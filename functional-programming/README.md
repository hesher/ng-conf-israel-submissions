Session Details
===============

### Session Title

The Principials of Functional Programming - All you need to get started.

### Session Abstract

JavaScript is on a journey. It's taking baby steps into becoming a full fledged language for large scale app development.
Still, it seems that it doesn't exactly know what it wants to be. An object oriented language or a functional one?

I'm going to show the functional side, which most people don't know exists or is possible. I Will highlight some awesome examples using various functional franeworks to introduce Practical Functional JavaScript to the audience.

It's an overview of the concepts with examples on how awesome it can be and why every one of us FED developers should try it tomorrow. (You don't have to be a ReactJS developer to do this)

I think most JavaScript developers come from OO languages and don't know or understand how cool functional programming is and how it can make code better to work with in making algorithm building blocks reusable.
The idea is to show the different concepts of functional programming. How it applies to JavaScript (either vanilla or using ad-hock libraries) and why it makes coding better and more fun (I really think it does)

I start with the very basics and end up with some advanced stuff.
